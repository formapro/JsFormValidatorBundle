### 2.2 Issue with sub-requests

All the necessary data for validation forms are initialized in the included template (initializer) that was defined on the step [1.3](../../README.md#p_1_3)
So if your form was rendered in sub-request, e.g.:
```twig
<div id="email">
    {{ render(controller('AcmeDemoBundle:Default:sendEmail')) }}
</div>
```
in this way the initializer does not know anything about that form.
To fix it, you have to add the initialization to your sub-template manually:
```twig
{# AcmeDemoBundle:Default:sendEmail.html.twig #}

{{ init_js_validation() }}

{{ form(form) }}
```
