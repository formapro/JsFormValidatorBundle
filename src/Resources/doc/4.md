## 4 Run tests

If you want to run tests for this bundle on your project, you have to:
- copy all the dev requirements from [here](https://github.com/formapro/JsFormValidatorBundle/blob/master/composer.json) to your main composer.json, which are not added yet.
- run ```php composer.phar update```
- navigate to the vendor/fp/jsformvalidator-bundle/Fp/JsFormValidatorBundle folder
- run in terminal ```sh run_tests.sh```
This shell script will make all the necessary settings to run the tests. This will require sudo.
If you do not trust this script - read it and do everything yourself step by step.

- do not forget to remove extra bundles from your composer.json after the testing

NOTE:
```run_tests.sh``` was removed from repo because does not support unymore  but you can find it [here](https://github.com/formapro/JsFormValidatorBundle/blob/a8d397d8d1761b3e025f8f1559dcf4a638c59621/run_tests.sh)
