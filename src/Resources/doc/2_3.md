### 2.3 Custom initialization

So, you have added this part into your template
```twig
<html>
    <head>
        {{ include('FpJsFormValidatorBundle::javascripts.html.twig') }}
    </head>
    <body>

    </body>
</html>
```

Let's look at what's inside:
```twig
<script src="{{ asset('bundles/fpjsformvalidator/js/fp_js_validator.js') }}" type="text/javascript"></script>
{{ js_validator_config() }}
{{ init_js_validation() }}
```

- the first line loads JS library
- the second one sends some parameters to this library
- the third line - this function processes all the forms which have been added to a queue before, and creates for each one its own JS validation model. So that if you have two or more forms on a page - all of them are processed by this function.

And if you want customize the initialization, you should leave the first and second lines at the header
```twig
<html>
    <head>
        <script src="{{ asset('bundles/fpjsformvalidator/js/fp_js_validator.js') }}" type="text/javascript"></script>
        {{ js_validator_config() }}
    </head>
    <body>

    </body>
</html>
```
and use the third line right at those places where you need it.

This function has three parameters:
```js
    init_js_validation(form = null, onLoad = true, wrapped = true)
```

- ```form``` By default this function processes all the forms which are added to the current queue. But if you want process only one specified form - put here a form name or a FormView instance of the necessary form.
For example, you have ```comment``` and ```user``` forms on a page:
```twig
    {{ form(comment) }}
    init_js_validation(comment)
    ...
    ...
    {{ form(user) }}
    init_js_validation(user)
```

- ```onLoad``` By default JS validation models are initialized on DocumentReady event, but if you need to init it later, on some other event, then you have to disable default behavior:
```twig
    {{ form(form) }}
    init_js_validation(null, false)
```
- ```wrapper``` this parameter just defines if the result should be wrapped with ```<script type="text/javascript">...</script>``` tag

For example, you need to initialize JS validation only after an ajax request:
```twig
    {{ form(user) }}
    <script type="text/javascript">
        $.ajax({
            ...
            ...
            complete: function() {
                {{ init_js_validation(null, false, false) }}
            }
        });
    </script>
```
- ```null``` means that all the available forms will be initialized
- first ```false``` means that initialization will be performed right at the moment when the 'complete' function is called
- second ```false``` means that JS code will not be wrapped with the 'script' tag
